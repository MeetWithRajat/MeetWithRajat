- **ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Rajat Roy,**

I'm a Python Developer with a strong passion for programming and a keen interest in advanced techniques.

I'm currently employed at TCS, where I actively contribute to the development of complex and innovative solutions while continuously analyzing and enhancing existing systems.

My primary programming language is Python, and I have hands-on experience working with a variety of AWS services, including Lambda, ECS, EC2, CloudWatch, SQS, and S3, to ensure effective monitoring and management of hosted components.
  

My professional journey has led me to specialize in Python and its associated modules, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am always open to collaborating on Python projects and exploring new opportunities to apply my skills and expertise.
